  - http://www.depressedpress.com/Content/Development/JavaScript/Extensions/DP%5FDeBug/

  - canvas navigation tools
    - zooming
    - panning
    - mini canvas viewer
  - shape layout tools
    - align: top, left, bottom, right, center-h, center-v
    - size: same height, same width, same both
  ---> this should be handled outside of the control
  ---> API level support should be provided, control should be
       outside, e.g. in umlcanvas, mediawiki extension or WebEditor
       - multi select
       - align methods
- start using JSDoc-toolkit

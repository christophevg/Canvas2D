- extend support for events
- introduce global logging framework with fallbacks (print, console, alert)

- group selection
  - move
- getmouseXY should take in account possible viewports ?! (for UMLWebEditor)
  - maybe more active with an external adjuster function
- canvas tag parameter passing (IE?)
- display shape layout settings (see also shapes DSL)
- toolbar: appear in "edit modus"
  - canvas navigation tools
    - zooming
    - panning
    - mini canvas viewer
  - shape layout tools
    - align: top, left, bottom, right, center-h, center-v
    - size: same height, same width, same both
  ---> this should be handled outside of the control
  ---> API level support should be provided, control should be
       outside, e.g. in umlcanvas, mediawiki extension or WebEditor
       - multi select
       - align methods
- do less automagically, more API with external control (e.g. source detection)
- clean up licensing information -> link to website with all info
- start using JSDoc-toolkit
- use Maven to manage project
- remove lib/* and fetch dependencies dynamically (see Maven)
- add some shapes, to make nicer demo (see visio ;-))
- shapes DSL -> adl from umlcanvas should be adopted at this level
- mediawiki extension
- look into using other existing toolkits to build this on (or replace with)

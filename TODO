0.1.0
- add keyboard short cuts to align/distribute shapes
- introduce library layer as virtual container of shapes
- introduce svg-path-shape
- add multi-connectorhead support
- add role names
- introduce #copy directive to allow referencing of previously defined shapes
- move connector.routing to position
- add some shapes, to make nicer demo (think visio ;-))
- use props.validation
- make UmlCanvas diagram with class model of Canvas2D

LATER
- build custom prototype.js including only what we need
- introduce global logging framework with fallbacks (print, console, alert)
  - http://www.depressedpress.com/Content/Development/JavaScript/Extensions/DP%5FDeBug/
- getmouseXY should take in account possible viewports ?! (e.g. for uWe)
  - this should be done with a registerable modifier function from outside
- toolbar: appear on mouse over
  - diagram navigation (next/prev)
  - canvas navigation tools
    - zooming
    - panning
    - mini canvas viewer
  - shape layout tools
    - align: top, left, bottom, right, center-h, center-v
    - size: same height, same width, same both
  ---> this should be handled outside of the control
  ---> API level support should be provided, control should be
       outside, e.g. in umlcanvas, mediawiki extension or WebEditor
       - multi select
       - align methods
- start using JSDoc-toolkit
- use Maven to manage project
- add full svg support

IDEAS FOR PLUGINS
- Navigator Toolbar
- Layout Toolbar
- add options for showing grid with custom size and align to grid

More Future Things
- CanvasCaption
- Composite shapes
- Macro shapes, catching and wrapping native canvas calls
- Link shape
- support gradients
- support rotation, resize of shapes
- allow DSL to omit Sheet declaration (for even less code)

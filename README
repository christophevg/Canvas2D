Canvas2D

---

Canvas2D is a lightweight wrapper API around the HTML5 canvas
element. It offers a shape-oriented interface.

...

Note: I'm trying to get things as polished as possible, but my current
focus is on a project that uses Canvas2D. When that reaches a stable
state, I'll add documentation and examples here also :-)

In a nutshell:
$ make
...
$ ls build
Canvas2D.js

Visit examples/ with your browser to see things in action and
while waiting for me to write decent documentation, study the code.

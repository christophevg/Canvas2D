Canvas2D is a lightweight OO wrapper API around the HTML5 canvas
element. It offers an extensible shape-oriented interface.

...

Note: I'm trying to get things as polished as possible, but my current
focus is on a project that uses Canvas2D. When that reaches a stable
state, I'll add documentation and examples here also :-)

In a nutshell:
$ make
*** building build/Canvas2D.shared.js
*** building build/Canvas2D.shared.min.js

Visit examples/ with your browser to see things in action and
while waiting for me to write decent documentation, study the code.

There is also a Mediawiki extension:

$ make dist
*** packaging Canvas2D distribution
*** packaging Canvas2D src distribution
*** packaging Canvas2D Mediawiki extenstion

$ ls dist/ext/Canvas2D/
Canvas2D.php			Canvas2D.standalone.min.js	LICENSE

Symlink/copy the extension directory to the Mediawiki extensions
directory and add

  require_once( "$IP/extensions/Canvas2D/Canvas2D.php" );

to your LocalSettings.php.

In your wiki pages you can include Canvas2D like this:

<canvas2d show="source,console,about" height="250" width="300">
[@ 75, 55] Rectangle rect1 +width=75 +height=75 +color="green";  
[@ 50,175] Rectangle rect2 +width=50 +height=50 +color="red";  
[@200,100] Rectangle rect3 +width=50 +height=50 +color="blue";  
[@200, 25] Rectangle rect4 +width=50 +height=50 +color="yellow";  
[@125,175] Rectangle rect5 +width=50 +height=50 +color="red";  

Connector conn1 +from="rect1" +to="rect2" +style="vertical";  
Connector conn2 +from="rect1" +to="rect3" +style="horizontal";  
Connector conn3 +from="rect1" +to="rect4" +style="horizontal";  
Connector conn4 +from="rect1" +to="rect5" +style="vertical";  
</canvas2d>
